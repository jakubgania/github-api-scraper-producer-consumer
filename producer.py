What does this script do?

- Fetches a single user with status 'pending' from Postgres and marks them as 'in_progress'
- Calls GitHub GraphQL, retrieves followers/following (with pagination), and pushes their logins into a Redis queue
- Enforces a fixed delay between requests to GitHub, respects rate limits, and can wait until reset if necessary
- Deduplicates logins globally (Redis SET), so the queue doesn't bloat with duplicates
- Stores pagination progress in the 'scraper_progress' table to resume exactly where it left off after a restart
- Logs events in a readable way (without leaking secrets)
